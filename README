WhereAmI is a simple WebOS application that I wrote while learning the WebOS Mojo SDK. It uses the freegeoip web service to show location information based on your IP address. It demonstrates how to call a JSON based web service and also use the WebOS application manager to open the maps application with the supplied data. 

The code is being made available under a BSD like license in case it is useful to someone.
